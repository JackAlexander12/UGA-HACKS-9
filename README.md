The purpose of the project, SafeTrade Connect, was to address the challenges and concerns associated with online marketplace transactions, particularly on platforms like Facebook Marketplace. The primary goal was to create a secure and reliable solution that instills trust in users by providing a platform for secure transactions. SafeTrade Connect aimed to streamline the process of making deals on online marketplaces by allowing users to put down deposits to reserve items, and then facilitating secure in-person exchanges with the help of a trusted third-party website. The overarching objective was to enhance the safety and confidence of users engaging in online commerce.

Our team encountered difficulties with the Python-MySQL database connection, leading us to switch to DynamoDB for a more seamless and effective development process in building a secure online marketplace solution.
